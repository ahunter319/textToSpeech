# Text to Speech Converter

***

This is a desktop app where the user can convert pdf's to speech, or enter their own text in the textbox to convert. There is a selection of languages and accents to chose from, though it doesn't do any translating. English text converted with the French option won't be played back in French, but it will have an accent! The user can try out their audio in the player, and if they so chose, they can save it as an mp3 on their device.  

### How to use

***

Simply download the executable, double click, and get converting! Or you could always run it from the command line, if you're feeling fancy. Unfortunately the program will only work on Windows. Sorry Mac/Linux users!
